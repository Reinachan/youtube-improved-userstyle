# Youtube Improved - UserStyles

This is a collection of userstyles for YouTube that I've made.

## Install

### YouTube Improved
This is the primary userstyle. Its major changes are reduced border-radiuses on various elements and made some changes to how videos are previewed on the homepage. It also changes how descriptions look and adds in chapter overview without expanding the description.

Install from [GitHub](https://github.com/Reinachan/youtube-improved-userstyle/raw/main/youtube-improved.user.css) or from [UserStyles.world](https://userstyles.world/user/reinachan)

### Shorts Improved
This removes the ability to scroll through shorts to prevent doom-scrolling. It also moves the interface away from the video.

Install from [GitHub]() or from [UserStyles.world](https://userstyles.world/user/reinachan).
